# Problem 3
Create a Drupal 8/7 custom module, which will exhibit a custom block with 3 mandatory field, i.e Title, Image, Description. When displaying these blocks, it must be formatted in the form of a tile, where we have the image first, then following it we have the title and then following it we have the description. For achieving this use proper custom twig template and associating some styling(can be CSS or SASS along with responsive designing) will be appreciated. We can add multiple blocks of this type on a single page, and each of them will have separate datasets in them. 
Secondly each of the individual blocks will have options to display/restrict them on the basis of IP address. So apart from these required fields, there can additional fields to add this functionality. Take the caching mechanism into consideration in order to avoid any flaw in display/restrict of this block. 
Please be considerate about Drupal coding standards while developing this module.
